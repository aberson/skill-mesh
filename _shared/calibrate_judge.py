"""Pure-Python, zero-live-LLM judge-calibration harness.

Gives the judging doctrine per-commit teeth: a deterministic CI gate that
verifies a recorded judge snapshot still (1) is fresh, (2) discriminates the
golden good fixture from the golden bad fixtures, and (3) agrees with the
hand-authored gold labels. NO LLM is invoked anywhere in this module: every
check runs against *recorded* artifacts that a prior judge run snapshotted.
The single live-judge piece (the stochastic position-swap / kappa sweep) is a
Phase-3 concern and is stubbed via ``mode="full"`` raising
``NotImplementedError``.

This module's docstring is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the calibration
data model (per dev/.claude/rules/code-quality.md "one source of truth for
data-shape constants"). The two on-disk artifacts below are the contract.

Gold artifacts (per skill, under ``<skill_dir>/evals/golden/``)
--------------------------------------------------------------
``verdicts.jsonl`` -- GOLD labels, one JSON object per non-blank line::

    {"fixture": "<name>.md", "verdict": "<enum>",
     "expected_block_anti_pattern": "<optional>"}

The ``verdict`` enum mirrors review-deep's lens verdict set:
``PASS | NEEDS-WORK | NO-EVIDENCE | FAILED | SKIPPED | NEEDS-CLARIFICATION``
(see review-deep/scripts/aggregate.py ``LensVerdict.overall_verdict``).
``expected_block_anti_pattern`` is OPTIONAL provenance carried for Phase-3 use
and is not consumed by the Phase-2 CI gate.

``recorded_scores.json`` -- the recorded judge snapshot::

    {
      "generated_at": "<ISO-8601 UTC>",        # freshness anchor
      "scorer": "<skill name>",
      "scores": { "<fixture>": <float> },        # recorded numeric score per
                                                 # fixture -> drives DISCRIMINATION
      "recorded_verdicts": { "<fixture>": "<verdict-enum>" }
                                                 # the categorical verdict the judge
                                                 # produced when snapshotted -> drives
                                                 # AGREEMENT/kappa vs gold
    }

The ``scores`` map is consumed by :func:`verify_discrimination`, which injects
``score_single_fn = lambda p: recorded_scores["scores"][p.name]`` into the
EXISTING :func:`score_skill_composite.verify_goldens`. That makes the
discrimination check pure (no LLM) -- it replays recorded numbers through the
same strict ``bad_score < good_score`` rule the live grader uses. The
``recorded_verdicts`` map is consumed by the AGREEMENT check, aligned to gold
by fixture name.

CI gate (mode="ci") -- all deterministic
----------------------------------------
1. FRESHNESS    -- ``recorded_scores["generated_at"]`` age <= FRESHNESS_MAX_AGE_DAYS.
2. DISCRIMINATION -- ``verify_goldens`` over recorded scores returns status
                   ``"ok"`` with empty ``sycophantic_bads`` (good outscores
                   every bad strictly).
3. AGREEMENT    -- recorded_verdicts aligned to gold; perfect agreement
                   (agreement_pct == 1.0, hence cohen_kappa == 1.0) is required
                   on the curated seed. The seed is hand-authored to be
                   perfectly consistent, so a strict 1.0 floor is correct -- a
                   mislabeled ``verdicts.jsonl`` (gold flipped) drops agreement
                   below 1.0 and fails the gate.

Any failing check -> ``passed: False`` with a reason. Missing or malformed
artifacts fail closed (caught, returned as ``passed: False``, never an
uncaught crash).

mode="full" -- PHASE-3 STUB
---------------------------
The live stochastic kappa sweep (re-running the judge N times over
position-swapped pairs to measure inter-run agreement + self-consistency)
needs live LLM judge runs and is therefore out of Phase-2 scope. It raises
``NotImplementedError`` so a caller that asks for it fails loudly rather than
silently getting a degenerate result.

:func:`compute_position_consistency` is implemented + unit-tested here with
INLINE fixtures only; it is NOT wired into ``mode="ci"`` because live
position-swap data needs live judge runs (Phase 3). It ships now as the
harness API Phase 3 will call.
