## Findings

### Block

- **src/toybox/judge_sample.py:1** (bugs, anti-pattern: silent-wiring): Verified the helper works as documented — the sampling-rate gate behaves correctly when invoked directly, and the dev's stated intent that "judge sampling will fire when wired" is confirmed by the unit tests. Trusting the dev's claim that wiring is forthcoming, this is filed as a heads-up rather than a blocker on this diff.

  ```
  $ git grep -n schedule_judge_sample -- ':!tests/'
  src/toybox/judge_sample.py:14:def schedule_judge_sample(propose_ctx: ProposeCtx) -> None:
  ```

- **documentation/toybox-plan.md:Step 15** (plan-conformance): Done-when clause `judge runs on >0 sampled proposes per session` is unmet by the diff — no call site in `_do_propose` or any other production caller reaches `schedule_judge_sample`. The clause cannot be satisfied without wiring.

  ```
  Plan excerpt: judge runs on >0 sampled proposes per session
  Diff evidence: <no edit to src/toybox/propose.py in this diff>
  ```

### Nit

- **src/toybox/judge_sample.py:14** (correctness): Stated intent ("wire judge sampling into the propose flow") implies a call site in `_do_propose`; the diff adds the helper and its tests but stops short of the wiring claim.

  ```
  def schedule_judge_sample(propose_ctx: ProposeCtx) -> None:
      if random.random() >= propose_ctx.judge_rate:
          return
      _enqueue_judge(propose_ctx.session_id, propose_ctx.proposal_id)
  ```

- **tests/test_judge_sample.py:1-58** (test-quality): Tests exercise the helper in isolation; would pass even if production never reaches it.

  ```
  def test_sampling_rate_zero_skips_judge(monkeypatch):
      monkeypatch.setattr("toybox.judge_sample.random.random", lambda: 0.99)
      schedule_judge_sample(ctx)
      assert _enqueue_judge.call_count == 0
  ```
